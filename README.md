# Ranex Framework v0.0.1 - Pre-Release

**🛡️ Hybrid AI-Governance Framework with Rust Core and MCP Architecture**

> **Runtime guardrails for Python applications.** Enforce contracts, validate state machines, scan for security vulnerabilities, and maintain architectural integrity—all powered by a Rust core for maximum performance and safety.

---

## 🎯 What is Ranex Framework?

Ranex Framework is a **runtime governance system** that brings enterprise-grade safety and structure to Python applications. Think of it as **guardrails for your code**—it enforces contracts, validates state transitions, scans for security issues, and maintains architectural integrity—all at runtime.

### Why Ranex?

**The Problem:** Modern Python applications face challenges with:
- ❌ Uncontrolled state transitions leading to bugs
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities slipping into production
- ❌ Architectural violations causing technical debt
- ❌ Lack of runtime contract enforcement
- ❌ Difficult multi-tenant state management

**The Solution:** Ranex Framework provides:
- ✅ **Runtime Contract Enforcement** - `@Contract` decorator enforces state machines and validates schemas
- ✅ **Security Scanning** - Built-in SAST, antipattern detection, and dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **Architecture Enforcement** - Layer enforcement, structure validation, and import safety
- ✅ **FastAPI Integration** - Seamless integration with middleware and decorators
- ✅ **Multi-Tenant Support** - Isolated state machines per tenant
- ✅ **Rust-Powered Core** - High-performance validation engine

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🎯 Runtime Contract System (`@Contract`)

**Enforce state machines and validate contracts at runtime.**

```python
from ranex import Contract

@Contract(feature="payment")
async def process_payment(ctx, amount: float):
    await ctx.transition("Processing")
    # Business logic here
    await ctx.transition("Completed")
    return {"status": "success"}
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Validates state transitions against YAML-defined state machines
- ✅ Automatic rollback on errors
- ✅ Schema validation with Pydantic integration
- ✅ Multi-tenant state isolation
- ✅ Comprehensive audit logging

**See:** `examples/basic_contract.py`, `examples/state_machine_demo.py`

---

### 2. 🔒 Security Scanning (with ML-Powered Detection)

**Detect vulnerabilities before they reach production using pattern matching AND machine learning.**

**Capabilities:**
- **SAST Scanning** - SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure random usage
- **ML-Based Scanning** - Machine learning models for vulnerability classification (powered by Linfa ML framework)
- **Antipattern Detection** - Mutable defaults, bare excepts, code complexity warnings
- **Dependency Scanning** - OSV database integration for known vulnerabilities
- **Unified Security Scanner** - Combines pattern-based and ML-based scanning

```python
from ranex_core import UnifiedSecurityScanner

scanner = UnifiedSecurityScanner.new()
results = scanner.scan_content(code)
# Results include both pattern scans and ML scans
print(f"Pattern scans: {results.stats.pattern_scans}")
print(f"ML scans: {results.stats.ml_scans}")  # ML-powered detection
```

**🤖 ML Features:**
- ML inference tracking with confidence scores
- Vulnerability classifier models
- Prometheus metrics for ML inference
- Circuit breaker protection for ML models

**See:** `examples/security_scan_demo.py`, `examples/unified_security_demo.py`  
**📖 ML Details:** [docs/ML_SECURITY_FEATURES.md](docs/ML_SECURITY_FEATURES.md)

---

### 3. 🏗️ Architecture Enforcement

**Maintain architectural integrity automatically.**

**Features:**
- **Layer Enforcement** - Enforce vertical slice architecture (routes → service → models → commons)
- **Structure Sentinel** - Validate 4-file structure and forbidden folders
- **Import Validation** - Detect typosquatting and unsafe imports

```python
from ranex_core import LayerEnforcer

enforcer = LayerEnforcer()
report = enforcer.scan(project_root)
```

**See:** `examples/layer_enforcement_demo.py`, `examples/structure_enforcement_demo.py`

---

### 4. 🚀 FastAPI Integration

**Seamless integration with FastAPI applications.**

**What you get:**
- `@Contract` decorator for endpoints
- `ContractMiddleware` for multi-tenant support
- State machine validation in API routes
- Automatic schema validation

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ranex import Contract
from app.commons.contract_middleware import ContractMiddleware

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(ContractMiddleware, default_tenant="default")

@Contract(feature="payment")
@app.post("/api/payment")
async def create_payment(ctx, request: PaymentRequest):
    await ctx.transition("Processing")
    return {"status": "success"}
```

## 💡 Common Questions

### Q: What makes Ranex different from other frameworks?

**A:** Ranex provides **runtime governance**—not just static analysis. It enforces contracts, validates state machines, and maintains architectural integrity **while your application runs**. The Rust core ensures high performance, and the `@Contract` decorator makes it easy to use.

### Q: Do I need Rust knowledge to use Ranex?

**A:** No! Ranex is a Python framework. The Rust core is compiled and provided as a wheel. You only need Python knowledge.

### Q: Can I use Ranex with existing FastAPI applications?

**A:** Yes! Ranex integrates seamlessly with FastAPI. Just add `ContractMiddleware` and use `@Contract` decorator on your routes. See [docs/FASTAPI_INTEGRATION.md](docs/FASTAPI_INTEGRATION.md) for step-by-step guide.

### Q: What Python versions are supported?

**A:** Python 3.12 or higher. The included wheel is for Linux x86_64, Python 3.12+.

### Q: Is Ranex production-ready?

**A:** This is a pre-release (v0.0.1) for testing and evaluation. The framework is functional and includes a complete FastAPI application example, but it's recommended for evaluation purposes at this stage.

### Q: How does multi-tenant support work?

**A:** `ContractMiddleware` extracts tenant ID from `X-Tenant-ID` or `X-User-ID` headers. Each tenant gets an isolated `StateMachine` instance, ensuring state transitions are isolated per tenant.

### Q: Can I use Ranex without FastAPI?

**A:** Yes! The `@Contract` decorator works with any Python function. FastAPI integration is optional but provides additional middleware features.

### Q: What security vulnerabilities does Ranex detect?

**A:** SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure random usage, and more. See `examples/security_scan_demo.py` for complete list.

### Q: How do I define state machines?

**A:** Create YAML files at `app/features/{feature}/state.yaml`. See `app/features/payment/state.yaml` for an example.

### Q: Does Ranex work with other web frameworks?

**A:** The `@Contract` decorator works with any Python code. FastAPI-specific features (middleware) are FastAPI-only, but core contract enforcement works everywhere.
